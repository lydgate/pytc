pytc.py
	Implement timezone aware datetimes
	In conversation mode, tweets are not always properly sorted -- why not?
	Better handling of conversations
	| Currently if one person tweets very quickly, you can lose half the
	| conversation. Rather than grepping for @s, maybe we can search a user's
	| stream for this somehow?
	Make it so -h and -v (and possibly -b) work without authentication.
README
