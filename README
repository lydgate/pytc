  Requirements
================

 - python
 - oauth-python-twitter2
   - python-oauth2 1.2.0
   - python-simplejson

oauth-python-twitter2:
http://code.google.com/p/oauth-python-twitter2/

oauth-python-twitter2 requires both oauth2 and simplejson.

oauth2:
http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2

simplejson:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

Once you've installed the oauth-python-twitter2 archive, then put
the file oauthtwitter.py into the pytc directory or your Python path.

Unfortunately, oauth-python-twitter2 currently has a bug which
prevents it from working with pytc.  See
http://code.google.com/p/oauth-python-twitter2/issues/detail?id=1

Since the authors don't seem to be fixing this, I've included
oauthpython.patch, which can be applied with this command:
patch -i oauthtwitter.patch

If you use Arch Linux, python-simplejson is in community and 
python-oauth2 is in the AUR.  You'll still need to get 
oauth-python-twitter2 though.

  Usage
=========

Please see pytc -h.
